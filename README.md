# MMC-Driver Experiences
Based on Kernel version 4.16.x

This is *not* a study of knowledge which you should be able to find a lot of documents in other places (i.e.: Kernel source).

Since I had problem to understand those documents, here I compile my reading (of documetns) / code tracing / and testing together. Hope it could benefit those people who have the same learn style as I do. If you found this materials sucks, it is, please accept my apologies.
